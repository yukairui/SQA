                          My Understanding of Software Quality Assurance 
                          
   In my opinion, software quality assurance is process oriented, and now many formal companies have paid great attention on software quality assurance to guarantee that the project be implemented according to the requirements and standards correctly.
   QA's job is to ensure the effective implementation of the project process and the supervision of project activities in accordance with the process,as the management representatives to ensure the implementation of the process.Software quality assurance (SQA) is to build a set of plan, a systematic approach to make sure standard, procedures, practices and methods planed can correctly be adopted by all project. 
   It is based on the software products and activities to review and audit to verify whether software is up to standard. Software quality assurance group should participate in the establishment of plans, standards and procedures at the beginning of the project. It can objectively verify whether the software product is following the appropriate standards, procedures and requirements and at the same time imforms the results to the relative developing group.
   From the perspective of my expeirence working in I believe the course will be very helpful for us in the future to work in large software companies or foreign enterprises.
